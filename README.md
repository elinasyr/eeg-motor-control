Perform data analysis on EEG measurements corresponding to real motion initiated by a visual stimulus. The experiment involves two scenarios of real motion: a visual command to either a) move both legs or b) keep both legs still. This assignment and its accompanying dataset are part of the Master's course "Biosignal Acquisition and Processing" at NTUA.
